Yes, it is possiblefor the state machine to go backwards in time. Suppose a machine has entries at indices where other machines have already committed to different values. Then, this machine receives a snapshot which overwrites some of these indices with commmitted values from other machines, and also removes the latest entries of the log, thus making the machine go back in time (fewer operations).
