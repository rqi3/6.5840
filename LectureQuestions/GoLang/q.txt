If imports in Go require the compiled fmt package's metadata to contain everything necessary to know about its own dependencies, why does this avoid the problem of a single statement needing to process tens or hundreds of packages? Because the package could import other packages, which import others resulting in needing to process more packages regardless, no? Is the point that the package compilation process happens only once?
